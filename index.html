        <p>Hello, I am Moyo, a frontend developer(intermediate). I am proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and while I am still a wet behind the ears, I am quick to learn on the job.</p>
        <p>This is not an official portfolio website. It was hastily made in response to the Stage 2 HNG task. Below are a list of my best projects.</p>

        <h1>But first, Why Should You Select Moyo?</h1>
        <p>I understand that there are better developers bidding for you, so here's my pitch about why you should select me. <br> I am a fast learner with the ability to learn on the job. I am creative and can easily adapted to any environment I find myself. I am known to be honest and accountable and will definitely not <i>"ghost"</i> on you. This is my chance to improve my skills, as well as yours, so let's work together.</p>
